## 💦 Assignments
The assignments are the same each semester, so you can download the source code from previous semesters and start early. Aim to get full marks for extra credit, which will help you achieve a high score even if the final exam is challenging. Make sure to understand the concepts and experiment with them. Try implementing additional features in your program—each small component can earn around 2 extra points.
